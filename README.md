# Week-3-Challenge-
This is the Challenge for Week 3 of the Bootcamp. Due date is the 3rd January at 23:59. I think this challenge was fairly easy as I had done something similar for my week 2 challenge, and I had everything pretty much finished except the footer by Monday 2nd Jan, but admittedly I got a bit lazy even though I only had a few extra lines to code. I found the footer work to be quite easy to implement and I found a website where I could implement the logos nicely without having to import images of the logos, and I think it has come out quite nicely, especially with the hover effect. I did have some issues trying to center the links for fb, twitter, linkedin and instagram as inline block just refused to work at first, but I did some tweaking with the transform values in line 162 of the css file and I eventually eyeballed it to center. In the future, I would like to experiment with some more interactivity options and try to make my sites a bit more dynamic, but I think for a week 3 challenge this is decent. I also don't feel like I have a great grasp on responsive media elements, are responsive media elements still required if you use Bootstrap? Big love to whoever grades this, hope you had a good Christmas break and happy new year :p

UPDATE FOR 16/1/23
As per the comments for my last submission, I have:
- Added the screenshots of my deployed sites, and linked the github pages deployed site in the readme file 
- Changed the index.html file so that the footer is no longer part of the contact me section, instead the contact me section is a seperate section, and the footer is only for the social media links
- I was penalised for as "Unfortunately, the hero is missing a picture or avatar." though I actually do have a batman avatar in the hero in place of an image of myself. I assume the marker simply didn't see this given that Batman is meant to be a master ninja? 

The link for the deployed site is:

Here are some screenshots of the deployed site:
